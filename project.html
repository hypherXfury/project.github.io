   <h4> PERSONALITY:</h4>
<br>
Personality describes the unique patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that distinguish a person from others. 
A product of both biology and environment, it remains fairly consistent throughout life.

Examples of personality can be found in how we describe other people's traits.
 For instance, "She is generous, caring, and a bit of a perfectionist," or "They are loyal and protective of their friends."

The word "personality" stems from the Latin word persona, which refers to a theatrical mask worn by performers to play roles or disguise their identities.
<p>
<h4>Impact of Personality:</h4>
<br>
Research on personality can yield fascinating insights into how personality develops and changes over the course of a lifetime. 
This research can also have important practical applications in the real world.<p>
For example, people can use a personality assessment to learn more about themselves and their unique strengths, weaknesses, and preferences.
Some assessments might look at how people rank on specific traits, such as whether they are high in extroversion, conscientiousness, or openness.

Other assessments might measure how specific aspects of personality change over time. Some assessments give people insight into how their personality affects many areas of their lives,
 including career, relationships, personal growth, and more.

Understanding your personality type can help you determine what career you might enjoy, how well you might perform in certain job roles,
or how effective a form of psychotherapy could be for you.

Personality type can also have an impact on your health, including how often you visit the doctor and how you cope with stress.
Researchers have found that certain personality characteristics may be linked to illness and health behaviors.<p>

<h4>PERSONALITY DISORDER:</h4>
<br>
While personality determines what you think and how you behave, personality disorders are marked by thoughts and behavior that are disruptive and distressing in everyday life.
Someone with a personality disorder may have trouble recognizing their condition because their symptoms are ingrained in their personality.
Personality disorders include paranoid personality disorder, schizoid personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder (BPD),
and narcissistic personality disorder (NPD).<p>

While the symptoms of personality disorders vary based on the condition, some common signs include:

Aggressive behavior
Delusional thinking
Distrust of others
Flat emotions (no emotional range)
Lack of interest in relationships
Violating others' boundaries

If you are concerned that elements of your personality are contributing to stress, anxiety, confusion, or depression, it's important to talk to a doctor or mental health professional.
They can help you understand any underlying conditions you may have.

It is often challenging to live with a personality disorder, but there are treatment options such as therapy and medication that can help.<p>

<h4>PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT:</h4>

There are a number of theories about personality, and different schools of thought in psychology influence many of these theories. 
Some theories describe how personalities are expressed, and others focus more on how personality develops.
One such popular theory of personality types is the Myers-Briggs theory.
The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator identifies a personality based on where someone is on the following continuums:
 introversion-extraversion, sensing-intuition, thinking-feeling.
After taking the personality test, you are assigned one of 8 personality types.


<h4>INTROVERTS:</h4>

It refers to the personality theory of persons whose psyche energy only limits their own thoughts and feelings. They thinks always about themselves.

Introverts are considered a shy person. They always focus on their own thoughts. They do not want opinions from other persons in the world.

There are some traits which signify that you are a introvert person:

You need quiet to concentrate.
So, You are reflective
You are self-aware.
Also, You generally take time for decisions.
You feel more comfortable being alone.
So, You don’t like to work in a group or want to work alone.
You prefer to write more than talk.
You feel tired after being in a crowd.
Introverts know what they like and don’t like. They are deeply connected with their values and know what they want to get out of life.
Such strong self confidence makes one more attractive, sophisticated, and desirable.<p>


<h4>EXTROVERTS:</h4>
<br>
Extroverts is a personality theory type of people. It is the opposite of introversion. The psyche energy flows towards the outer world and other people. These types of persons are very social able and very open-minded.

Extroverts are often described as the life of the party. Their outgoing, vibrant nature draws people to them, and they have a hard time turning away the attention. They thrive off the interaction.

There are some traits which signify that you are a Extrovert person:

You enjoy social settings.
So, You don’t want to live alone for a long time.
You thrive around people.
Also, You are a friend of many people.
You prefer to talk out about problems and solutions.
Above symbols shows that a person have an extroverted personality.
A person who is an extrovert, take pleasure in activities that involve large social gatherings, such as parties, community activities, public demonstrations, 
and business or political groups.<br>
They also tend to work well in groups.<br>

<h4>1. Sensation</h4>
A mental condition or physical feeling resulting from stimulation of a sense organ or from internal bodily change, as cold or pain.
A state of excited feeling or interest caused among a number of persons or throughout a community, as by some rumor or occurrence.
It is completely reverse of the function Intuition. It refers to the process of gathering the information directly from the sensory organs rather than from the unconscious.

<h4>2. Thinking</h4>
Thinking is a core function in human personality. This function mostly uses logic and reasons and focus n less emotions.
Thinking means that when a person observes anything around himself and around the environment and thinks about that thing and which he wants to explore more.
Also, a person thinks after any discussion or event.

<h4>3. Feelings</h4>
Jung defined feeling as “primarily a process that takes place between the ego and a given content.
It is like something you want to express. For example, Happiness, sadness, excitements, etc. are the feeling which a person can feel.

<h4>4. Intuition</h4>
This is the last function of human’s personality. It refers to the ability to understand something quickly without the conscious reasoning.
It is that psychological function which transmits perceptions in an unconscious way.

Now the two attitudes of human that we discussed already i.e.
Introversion and Extroversion are combined with previously discussed four functions, which results in formation of 8 functional variations.
This can be setermined with a simple test.
